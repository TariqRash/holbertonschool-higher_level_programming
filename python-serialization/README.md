# Python - Serialization

## Description
This project explores marshaling and serialization, fundamental concepts for efficient data storage and transmission. We implement various serialization techniques using JSON, Pickle, CSV, and XML formats, and apply them in network communication scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the differences between marshaling and serialization
- Implement serialization in practical programming tasks
- Apply serialized data in web applications and network communications
- Evaluate performance implications of different serialization formats
- Master data persistence and distributed computing concepts

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- All files must be executable
- PEP 8 style compliance (pycodestyle 2.7.*)
- Comprehensive documentation for all modules and functions

## Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| task_00_basic_serialization.py | Basic JSON serialization and deserialization |
| task_01_pickle.py | Custom class serialization using pickle |
| task_02_csv.py | CSV to JSON conversion |
| task_03_xml.py | XML serialization and deserialization |
