# Python - Input/Output

## Description
This project explores file handling, JSON serialization/deserialization, and data persistence in Python. We learn to read and write files, work with JSON format, and implement object serialization mechanisms.

## Learning Objectives
- Master file reading and writing in Python
- Understand the `with` statement for resource management
- Learn JSON serialization and deserialization
- Convert between Python objects and JSON strings
- Implement class serialization mechanisms
- Work with command line arguments
- Handle file operations safely

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle 2.7.*
- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and methods must have documentation
- Use `with` statement for file operations

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0-read_file.py | Read and print text file |
| 1-write_file.py | Write string to file |
| 2-append_write.py | Append string to file |
| 3-to_json_string.py | Convert object to JSON string |
| 4-from_json_string.py | Convert JSON string to object |
| 5-save_to_json_file.py | Save object to JSON file |
| 6-load_from_json_file.py | Load object from JSON file |
| 7-add_item.py | Add arguments to list in JSON file |
| 8-class_to_json.py | Convert class instance to dict |
| 9-student.py | Student class with JSON serialization |
| 10-student.py | Student with filtered JSON |
| 11-student.py | Student with reload from JSON |
| 12-pascal_triangle.py | Pascal's triangle generator |
| 100-append_after.py | Insert text after matching lines |
| 101-stats.py | Log parsing with metrics |

## Concepts Covered
- File I/O operations
