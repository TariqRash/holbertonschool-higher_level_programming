# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description
This project dives deeper into Object-Oriented Programming in Python, exploring advanced concepts like class attributes, static methods, class methods, special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__del__`), and operator overloading.

## Learning Objectives
- Master the difference between class and instance attributes
- Understand and implement `__str__` vs `__repr__`
- Learn about class methods and static methods
- Implement the `__del__` destructor
- Use class attributes to track instances
- Understand Python's attribute lookup mechanism
- Master the `__dict__` attribute

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- pycodestyle 2.7.*
- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and methods must have documentation
- No module imports allowed (unless specified)
