# Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

## Description
This project explores advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python, focusing on abstract base classes, interfaces, duck typing, multiple inheritance, and mixins. We learn to design flexible and robust class hierarchies using Python's ABC package and OOP principles.

## Learning Objectives
- Master abstract classes and abstract methods
- Understand interfaces and duck typing in Python
- Extend standard base classes (list, iterator)
- Implement method overriding effectively
- Apply multiple inheritance correctly
- Utilize mixins for composable behavior

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- All files must be executable
- All modules, classes, and methods must have documentation
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| task_00_abc.py | Abstract Animal class with Dog and Cat subclasses |
| task_01_duck_typing.py | Shape interface with Circle and Rectangle |
| task_02_verboselist.py | Extended list class with notifications |
| task_03_countediterator.py | Iterator with counting capability |
| task_04_flyingfish.py | Multiple inheritance example |
| task_05_dragon.py | Mixin composition example |

## Concepts Covered
- Abstract Base Classes (ABC)
- Duck Typing
- Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Multiple Inheritance
- Mixins
- Subclassing Built-in Types
